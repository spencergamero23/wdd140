        Hi my name is Spencer, this is a website I've made to show off some projects I've worked on but also to show some things in my own life. This home page has some projects I'm working on or already been apart of. (I would show my personal project, an album selector, as well as this service project I've been working on. Once it's complete of course.)

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Spencer Gamero. I was born in February 23rd 2004 and I have 2 sisters and 1 brother. I have a dog named Toffee who I love very much! Some hobbys of mine are listening to music and cooking. I like practicing making stuff taste better always makes me feel good. I also really like being active. I have fun playing basketball as well as running. I enjoy watching sports like soccer and basketball and my favorite tv show is Seinfeld but Curb Your Enthusiasm is a close second.

      <h3>Silly Dog</h3>
      <p>
        This is my silly puppy Toffee. She's an absolute sweet heart who loves to sleep and watch out the window. Although she is very stubborn! Whenever I take her out to play she refuses to stop! If she gets a little tired she'll lay down and then bark at you to keep throwing the ball. She loves trips to starbucks as well because she knows she's gonna get her pup cup! I love her so much! She's my pride and joy.
