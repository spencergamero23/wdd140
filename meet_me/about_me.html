            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Spencer Gamero. I was born in February 23rd 2004 and I have 2 sisters and 1 brother. I have a dog named Toffee who I love very much! Some hobbys of mine are listening to music and cooking. I like practicing making stuff taste better always makes me feel good. I also really like being active. I have fun playing basketball as well as running. I enjoy watching sports like soccer and basketball and my favorite tv show is Seinfeld but Curb Your Enthusiasm is a close second.

            <p> This is a photo of me after I made some food. I've recently discovered that I really enjoy cooking! It's fun to experiment with different ingredients and as someone who really enjoys eating food it's a plus that I get to eat it after.</p>

            <p>Fly or Die by N.E.R.D. is one of my favorite albums of all time. I know almost every word from memory and I could just listen to this album on repeat. I had a huge N.E.R.D. phase this last year and I just wish I got some more merch from them.</p>

            <p>The Seattle Supersonics were once a basketball team in Seattle Washington! Now they're the Oklahoma City Thunder but there are rumours that the Sonics might come back home with the upcoming NBA expansion. I really want a team back in Seattle. Not just because it would be awesome to go basketball games but because Seattle is a basketball city!</p>

            <p> I'm a big fan of dry humour. So when I started watching Seinfeld in middle school it just seemed like the perfect thing for me.</p>

            <h2> Allen Iverson</h2>
            <p> Allen Iverson is one of my favorite basketball players. Not only was he a huge influence on the basketball players presented themselves and played but he was a huge influence on the fans themselves. Not just that but him being 6 ft. in the NBA and putting up the numbers he did was crazy. To me he will always be one of the coolest players ever and my own personal GOAT.</p>
