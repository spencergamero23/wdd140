            <h2>Hi my name is Spencer, this is a website I've made to show off some projects I've worked on but also to show some things in my own life. This home page has some projects I'm working on or already been apart of. (I would show my personal project, an album selector, as well as this service project I've been working on. Once it's complete of course.)</h2>

All you do is give it a genre and then a number of albums. It then randomly selects the amount of albums from the list and gives it back.</div>
