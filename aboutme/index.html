    <h2>Spencer Gamero</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Spencer Gamero I'm looking to be a software engineer. Some things I love to do are watch movies and listen to music. I also love walking my dog. She's at home right now in Washington with my parents. I was born into the church and my favorite scripture would be Mosiah 4:16-20. I'm very excited to start this semester off right!</p>
